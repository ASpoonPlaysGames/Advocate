### **Advocate requires that you install [RePak](https://github.com/r-ex/RePak/releases) and [texconv](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases/latest) to function**
!! IMPORTANT !!
RePak recently changed their json format, so Advocate needs to be updated to support that. In the meantime use this version: https://github.com/r-ex/RePak/releases/tag/1.2.0
